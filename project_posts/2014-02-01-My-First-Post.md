### Stage one, Microsoft Imagine Cup
We, [PoloKirch](https://github.com/PoloKirch/) and [DmitryShevtsov](https://github.com/DmitryShevtsov/), thought of a cool interactive art-installation project: Kinect-controlled human figure, filled with boids (bird-like objects).
At first (at Microsoft Games+Apps Imagine Cup Hackathon, 15-16 Feb 2014, Moscow), the idea for gameplay was such: there is one figure and other two players send boid groups to the figureâ€™s direction. The figure uses a shield to defend from these groups. If it fails to defend (the shield misses the group), boids from the group dislodge boids from the figure, making it less dense. If the figure successfully defends, boids from the group join boids from the figure, making it denser.

The audience loved the concept, and we won first place.

There's video of the gameplay:

The mechanics of flying boids is a thing we particularly love.
